# Movie explorer

### Motivation:

We started this project as a practice in the Front-end bootcamp, but we did not finished completely.

After camp graduation I wanted to continue with a new design and anew approach in order to practice skills I learned on the way.

### Technologies:

-   **JavaScript:** I am using React as it is my strongest suit and I adapted the Container/view design pattern while using functional components with hooks.
-   **CSS:** I am using Material UI because I just love it and it comes with "CSS in JS" tool that is similar to styled components which makes bootstraping a view component with its CSS efficiently.
-   **Data source:** I am using The movie Database public API with native fetch functions.
